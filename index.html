                    <p>Hi there, Dilek Düştegör here!</p> 
		    <p>I am an Assistant Professor with Education Profile at the Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence of the University of Groningen, Netherlands. I am a member of the Distributed Systems group. My current research is focused on distributed decision making for smart environments, cyber-physical systems and digital twins, and pervasive computing for ambient intelligence, with a particular interest in sustainable applications for critical systems like water and energy management.</p>
                    <p>As an engineer (both in training and at heart), I have always been passionate about practical applications of theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems and improve existing technologies. I root for the valorization of research, especially through the creation of societal values, which makes me wander at the frontier of academia and industry, through  collaborations and the development of training for professionals.</p>
