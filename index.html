                    <p>Hi there, Dilek Düştegör here, an Assistant Professor with Education Profile at the Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence of the University of Groningen, Netherlands. I am a member of the Distributed Systems group. My current research is focused on distributed decision making for smart environments, cyber-physical systems and digital twins, and pervasive computing for ambient intelligence, with a particular interest in sustainable applications for critical systems like water and energy management.</p>
                    <p>As an engineer (both in training and at heart), I have always been passionate about practical applications of theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems and improve existing technologies. I root for the valorization of research, especially through the creation of societal values, which makes me wander at the frontier of academia and industry, through research collaborations and the development of training for professionals.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>[03.06.24]</strong> I am co-organizing <a href="https://distributeddigitaltwins.github.io/">the First Distributed Digital Twins (DiDiT) workshop</a>, which will happen on June 17th in Groningen. The full program is now available.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>[07.05.24]</strong> Our collaboration with Grenoble INP Genie Industriel and 4 industrial partners, has been awarded a one year EIT Manufacturing grant for the project "Data Science Training for Solving Manufacturing Issues (ViDi)". More information about the <a href="https://www.eitmanufacturing.eu/calls/second-call-for-proposals-2024/">EITM funding call's</a>.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>[30.11.23]</strong> Our consortium of 7 research and industrial partners, has been awarded a grant for the project "Intelligent Wastewater Treatment: Distributed Digital Twin for Clean Water (DDTclean)". One PhD position for the Bernouilli Institute is funded by this project.

		<h3>Current Research Projects</h3>
                        <ul>
			  <li><h4><strong>ViDi: Data Science Training for Solving Manufacturing Issues - EIT Manufacturing</strong></h4></li>
				<p>ViDi focuses on the training of professionals for the digital transformation and a sustainable manufacturing of the future. Following a blended andragogical learning approach, learners will be trained to design, develop, implement and deploy the correct Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS) solution adapted to real manufacturing cases, especially related to production systems optimization, quality control and maintenance</p>
			  <li><h4><strong>DDTClean: Intelligent Wastewater Treatment: Distributed Digital Twin for Clean Water - NWO</strong></h4></li>
				<p>DDTclean focuses on the development of future-facing wastewater treatment technologies. These novel technologies can provide intelligent wastewater governance, including collection and treatment, with the help of electrochemical-membrane technologies and scalable Artificial Intelligence enhanced distributed Digital Twin framework. This project addresses the existing dilemma of low treatment efficiency of decentralised wastewater, while facilitating the communication and coordination of multiple stakeholders, aiming to improve the environmental quality, especially in remote areas, and to contribute to system-wide optimal operations.</p>
			  <li><h4><strong>AISME: Supporting AI solutions in SMEs - EIT Manufacturing</strong></h4></li>
				<p>AISME is a European project funded by EITM that is building courses for the digital transformation, from SMEs to SMEs. AISME project aims at training managers, engineers and technicians, working in or for SMEs, guiding manufacturing SMEs to implement AI solutions.</p>
